   contain the root `toctree` directive.

The Piccol programming language
===============================

Piccol is programming language that is

  * Embeddable and small
  * Statically-typed and strict
  * Purely functional
  * Very easy to extend and modify.
  * Bundled with a metaprogramming toolbox for extending syntax.

It is a language in the spirit of Lua, Tcl and Scheme, only on the other end of the strictness scale, inspired by
Standard ML, C++ and Haskell.

Piccol is implemented as a C++11 header-only library, along with a set of executable grammar definitions. 
(These can be compiled into your app if you so wish.)

You will need a C++11 compiler to use Piccol. 
(Piccol has been tested and works with modern versions of gcc.)

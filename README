== Intro ==

Piccol is a simple, small, strict and statically-typed scripting 
extension language for embedding into a larger application.

== Mission statement ==

Why not Lua, Javascript, Scheme, Tcl, Python?

Existing extension languages (Lua is a great example) are wonderful, and I use them daily. 
But they are made for a specific purpose: to allow for easy and rapid prototyping 
of features, especially by people who are not professional programmers or not 
very familiar with the app they are trying to extend. 

Piccol is made to fill a very different niche. 

Existing languages are designed to make adding new features easy.
Piccol is designed to make breaking existing functionality is hard.

Piccol is a very strict, bondage-and-discipline, "hairshirt" language 
which has extensive compile-time checking and a limited feature set.
